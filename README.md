# UniBring

UniBring is a university-only peer assistance platform that connects day scholars with in-campus hostel students to bring permitted items into campus. The app focuses on safety, accountability, and university compliance without handling real money.


---

## 🚀 Overview

Hostel students often face difficulty accessing essential items due to campus restrictions, while day scholars already travel in and out daily. UniBring bridges this gap by enabling trusted, student-to-student assistance within a closed university ecosystem.

The platform ensures fairness and safety through request locking, proof-based delivery, and a virtual campus credit system.
